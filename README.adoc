= How to setup `spring-data-aerospike` in Spring Boot application

This repository contains sample project for demonstration of `spring-data-aerospike` setup and usage.

== Setting up the project

In this section we'll cover setup of the project from the start.

In Spring Initializr you'll need to select:

favorite IDE and run the test. It should be green and that means that you are ready to continue to the next section.

and is not included into Spring Boot dependency management. Available versions can be checked on
